            Our charity partners will determine whether your order will be
            delivered by Royal Mail or by their selected courier company and
            only deliver to addresses within the United Kingdom (including
            Northern Ireland); this excludes PO Box addresses and BFPO
            addresses.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Together with our charity shop partners we try our best to ensure
            punctual delivery. However we cannot guarantee the exact delivery
            date.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You will not hold us responsible for any delays, outside our
            control, which relate to deliveries. In the event of a delay by
            Royal Mail or a courier, we are unable to offer a refund or to
            resend your delivery.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We are unable to provide delivery notifications for Royal Mail
            orders. We do not obtain proof of delivery.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We cannot guarantee that delivery instructions will be followed.

            Our charity shop partners reserve the right to use alternative
            delivery methods without prior notification.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It is your responsibility to report all lost or undelivered boxes
            online within 7 days of the expected day of delivery. Failure to do
            so will result in the lapse of any rights to a refund.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If your box does not fit through your letterbox and you are out when
            it is delivered, your postal carrier should leave a card at the
            address with information about collection or re-delivery. It is your
            responsibility to contact them to arrange receipt of the box as soon
            as you can. The postage provider will hold the box for a reasonable
            period of time before returning it to the sender. We cannot be held
            responsible for refunding or replacing the box if this process has
            not been followed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you change address, you must update your address details in the
            relevant section of the website to ensure that boxes are not sent
            out to the wrong address. Please ensure this is done in time to take
            effect before you move as you will not be refunded or credited for
            any boxes posted to the previous address.

          <p className="mb-4">
            We offer a no quibbles returns policy, which begins from the date
            you received the goods. You have 14 days from receipt of your item
            to notify us you wish to return it, then have 14 days from notifying
            us to return the item. If you contact us outside of the 14-day

            refund the order.

            fully resalable condition, we reserve the right to refuse a refund
            on the item.

            providing 5 days notice before any intended delivery within your
            subscription plan. In such circumstances the pause or cancellation
            will take effect without charge. Where notice is provided after that
            time, please note you will still receive and be charged for your

          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You understand that Charity Shop Exchange does not manufacture,
            store or inspect any of the items sold through our service. We
            provide the website and mechanism for charity shop operators to
            supply items directly to you, so Charity Shop Exchange can’t and
            does not make any warranties. You release Charity Shop Exchange from
            any claims related to items sold through our services.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Whilst we agree to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the
            Charity Shop Exchange service is fully operational and error-free we
            cannot guarantee this and, therefore, accept no responsibility for
            any interruption of the Charity Shop Exchange service and shall be
            released from our obligations under these Terms and Conditions in
            the event of any cause beyond our reasonable control which renders
            the provision of the Charity Shop Exchange service impossible or
            impractical.

          <p className="mb-4">
            In no event shall we be liable to you for any business losses. Any
            liability we do have for losses shall in no circumstances exceed the
            price paid to us for the order in question (defined as an individual
            delivery within a particular week, not an entire subscription).
