          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We acknowledge that the information you provide may be confidential
            and will maintain the confidentiality of and protect your
            information in accordance with our normal procedures and all
            applicable laws. We employ appropriate technical and organisational
            security measures to help protect your personal data against loss
            and to guard against access by unauthorised persons. We have put in
            place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and
            will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach
            where we are legally required to do so.

          <p className="mb-4">

          <p className="mb-4">
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is
            not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
            personal data, for example by encrypting our outgoing email
            communications, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
            transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk.
            Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and
            security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
